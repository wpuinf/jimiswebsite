            Hey Martin,<br>I hope you're OK and preparing for the final exams isn't too stressful. Mum told me that you're thinking about spending some time abroad once you've left school.<br>I just wanted to let you know that I've found an amazing offer for you: The "Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr" (Voluntary social year).<br>It is a great opportunity to learn the language, meet new people and do something good: You'll have a unpaid social job such as a Caregiver, Kindergarden teacher, etc.<br>You'll receive an allowance of 150€ (125£) and free housing and food. All you need to apply is:<br>
            - A criminal record certificate<br>
            - Basic knowledge of German<br>
            - A driver's license<br>
            - A visa<br>
            Have a good day, <br>Tim.
        </p>
